# cnft-image-downloader
### A python script to download CNFT images that a wallet address contains.
When running the script, it will prompt you a wallet address, followed by a location on the computer where to download the images.<br>
This is a very bare-bones and simple script for Python, used primarily for quick jobs to extract multiple NFT images (in my case, for a photo frame).
